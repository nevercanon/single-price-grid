## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

### Screenshot

I will provide screenshots in my Github Repository.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project is the first one I've ever used CSS Grid on. Though it was fairly simple, I'm proud that I used it and that I figured it out without too much difficulty. 

This is also the first project that I haven't set a minimum width on, which allowed it to grow as the screen size grew, which was my goal. I'm very happy with how it turned out. The only thing I would like to have changed was to keep the link in the center as it grew. 

I had more practice with box-shadow on this project as well. I'm not super happy with how that turned out. I don't think I got the correct color, since the shadow color wasn't provided in the style guide. I am glad that I was able to get it somewhat close to the sample design image.

### Continued development

I would like to continue working with Grid, and doing more complex projects with it to improve my skills. I also want to work on making my pages even more responsive. I also am planning on practicing with box-shadows so I can get them even more similar to the design images.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - This is the video I watched to learn the basics of Grid. 
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - I reviewed this article to help with the box-shadow effect.
